  <div class="plant-description">
      <p>A small perennial plant with finely divided green leaves and thick, red stalks. It produces clusters of white berries with a dark purple or black "pupil" spot, resembling creepy doll's eyes. The berries stand out vividly against the green foliage, making them highly noticeable — and dangerous.</p>

<br>
    <h2>Location</h2>
<p> The plant is native to eastern North America, in eastern Canada, and the Midwestern and Eastern United States. It prefers clay to coarse loamy upland soils, and is found in hardwood and mixed forest stands.</p>
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This herbaceous perennial plant grows to 46–76 cm (18–30 in) or more tall.[2][3] It has toothed, bipinnate compound leaves up to 40 cm (16 in) long and 30 cm (12 in) broad.</p>
<p>The white flowers are produced in spring in a dense raceme about 10 cm (3.9 in) long. The plant's most striking feature is its fruit, a 1 cm (1⁄2 in) diameter white berry, whose size, shape, and black stigma scar give the species its other common name, "doll's eyes". The pedicels thicken and become bright red as the berries develop.</p>
<br>
<h2>Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actaea pachypoda is cultivated as an ornamental plant, in traditional and wildlife gardens.

    It requires part or full shade, rich loamy soil, and regular water with good drainage to reproduce its native habitat</p>
<br> 
<h2>Toxicology</h2>
<p>Both the berries[7] and the entire plant are considered poisonous to humans. The berries contain cardiogenic toxins which can have an immediate sedative effect on human cardiac muscle tissue, and are the most poisonous part of the plant. Ingestion of the berries can lead to cardiac arrest and death.</p>
