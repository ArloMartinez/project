<h4>General Information about Poisonous Plants</h4>
<hr>
<br>

<h2>Where Poisonous Plants Grow</h2>
<p>
Poisonous plants can be found in almost every part of the world, from tropical rainforests to dry deserts and even in our own gardens. Some of the most dangerous plants grow in warm, humid areas where vegetation is thick and diverse. However, even in colder climates, certain species can still be toxic to humans and animals.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Why Plants are Poisonous</h2>
<p>
Many poisonous plants protect themselves by producing chemicals that are harmful when touched or eaten. These toxins can cause reactions like rashes, stomach problems, breathing difficulties, or even death. Some plants only cause mild irritation, while others are deadly even in very small amounts.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Common Poisonous Plants</h2>
<p>
It is important to recognize poisonous plants when spending time outdoors. Plants like Aconitum (Wolfsbane) in Europe, Manchineel trees in the Caribbean, and Oleander in warmer climates are especially dangerous. Some toxic plants have bright berries or beautiful flowers, which can easily attract the attention of children and pets.

<h2>How to Stay Safe</h2>
<p>
Learning about local poisonous plants is essential for safety. Always avoid touching unknown plants, and never eat berries, leaves, or seeds unless you are sure they are safe. In many places, guides or park rangers provide information about plants you should watch out for. Knowing the risks helps people enjoy nature without accidents.
