  <div class="plant-description">
      <p>A medium-sized tree with glossy, dark green, elongated leaves. It has attractive white flowers with yellow centers that look similar to oleander blooms. Its fruits are green, fibrous, and about the size of a small apple, turning red as they ripen. Inside, the seeds are the most toxic part.</p>

<br>
    <h2>Location</h2>
<p>It is native to South and Southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and Queensland, Australia,[4] growing preferentially along sandy coasts, riverbanks, and by mangrove swamps. It is also grown in tropical areas such as Hawaii as an ornamental.</p>
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cerbera odollam bears a close resemblance to oleander, another highly toxic plant from the same family. It grows to approximately 10–12 meters in height. Its leaves are glossy and it has white flowers with yellow throats.[6] The plant as a whole yields a milky, white latex.[citation needed]

    Its fruit, about 5–10cm in length, starts green and becomes red as it matures.[7] It has a green fibrous shell enclosing an ovoid kernel measuring approximately 2 cm × 1.5 cm and containing two extremely poisonous seeds. On exposure to air, the white kernel turns violet, then dark grey, and ultimately brown, or black.</p>
<br>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Use for suicide
    Cerbera odollam was also frequently used for suicide and continues to be used for this purpose in the modern day. For instance, a 2004 study found that it was responsible for about one suicide death per week between 1989 and 1999 in Kerala, India.[13] To commit suicide, people would remove the kernels from the seed and combine it with jaggery to eat. Death would occur quickly, about 3-6 hours after ingestion.</p>
<p>Use in trials by ordeal
    The poisonous kernel of the Cerbera odollam fruit was used in trials by ordeal like the tangena throughout the regions where it grew. In Madagascar in the 18th and 19th centuries, over 3000 people died per year from consuming Cerbera odollam seeds in a trial by ordeal. These trials were intended to determine whether the subject was guilty of a crime, often witchcraft.</p>
<br> 
<h2>Toxicology</h2>
<p>Cerberin, the poisonous compound in the kernels of Cerbera odollam, is a cardiac glycoside and, as such, blocks the heart's sodium and potassium ATPase.[15] One kernel contains a fatal dose of the toxin.</p>
<br>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Electrocardiographic abnormalities are common, the most common being sinus bradycardia.[17] Around half of the patients develop thrombocytopenia. Temporary cardiac pacing has been used in the management, apart from other supportive measures.[18]

    Other common symptoms of cerberin poisoning include a burning sensation in the mouth, vomiting, retching, nausea, irregular respiration, headache, coma, and death.[19] Some cases are asymptomatic.</p>
