   <h3>Plants that cause illness or death after consuming them are referred to as poisonous plants</h3>
   <br>
   <p class="center-paragraph">
    Poisonous plants exist all around the world, in forests, gardens, and even inside homes. 
Some plants evolved toxins to protect themselves from animals and insects. 
While many look beautiful and harmless, touching or consuming them can cause serious health problems. 
In some cases, just a small amount can lead to paralysis or death. 
Poisonous plants have been used throughout history for hunting, medicine, and even in crimes. 
Knowing how to recognize dangerous plants is important to stay safe in nature. 
Every region has its own species that should be handled with care and respect.</p>

      <h1>3. Agrostemma githago (Corn-cockle)</h1>
      <p>Contains the saponins githagin and agrostemmic acid. All parts of the plant are reported to be poisonous and may produce chronic or acute, potentially fatal poisoning, although it has been used in folk medicine to treat a range of ills, from parasites to cancer.</p>

      <h1>4. Cerbera odollam (Pong Pong tree)</h1>
      <p>The seeds contain cerberin, a potent toxin related to digoxin. The poison blocks the calcium ion channels in heart muscle, causing disruption of the heartbeat. This is typically fatal and can result from ingesting a single seed. Cerberin is difficult to detect in autopsies and its taste can be masked with strong spices, such as a curry. It is often used in homicide and suicide in India</p>
