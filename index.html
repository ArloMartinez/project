   <h2>5 most poisonous plants:</h2>
   <br>
   <h1>1. Aconitum spp (Most commonly known as wolfsbane)</h1>
   <p>All parts are poisonous, containing an alkaloid called aconitine, which disables nerves, lowers blood pressure, and can stop the heart. Even casual skin contact should be avoided. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and cardiac irregularity. It has been used as a poison for bullets</p>

   <h1>4. Cerbera odollam (Most commonly known as Pong Pong tree)</h1>
   <p>The seeds contain cerberin, a potent toxin related to digoxin. The poison blocks the calcium ion channels in heart muscle, causing disruption of the heartbeat. This is typically fatal and can result from ingesting a single seed. Cerberin is difficult to detect in autopsies and its taste can be masked with strong spices, such as a curry. It is often used in homicide and suicide in India</p>

   <h1>5. Dieffenbachia spp (Most commonly known as Dumbcane)</h1>
   <p>All parts are poisonous; the culprits are needle-shaped crystals of calcium oxalate called raphides, which can cause intense burning, reddening of the skin, irritation, and immobility of the tongue, mouth, and throat if ingested.[citation needed] Swelling can be severe enough to block breathing, leading to death</p>
