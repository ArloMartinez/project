   <h1>let's talk about poisonous flowers</h1>
   <br> 
   <h3>plants that cause illness or death after consuming them are referred to as poisonous plants</h3>
   <br><br>
   Poisonous plants exist all around the world, in forests, gardens, and even inside homes. 
Some plants evolved toxins to protect themselves from animals and insects. 
While many look beautiful and harmless, touching or consuming them can cause serious health problems. 
In some cases, just a small amount can lead to paralysis or death. 
Poisonous plants have been used throughout history for hunting, medicine, and even in crimes. 
Knowing how to recognize dangerous plants is important to stay safe in nature. 
Every region has its own species that should be handled with care and respect.

   <h2>5 most poisonous plants in the World:</h2>

   <p>All parts are poisonous, containing an alkaloid called aconitine, which disables nerves, lowers blood pressure, and can stop the heart. Even casual skin contact should be avoided. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and cardiac irregularity. It has been used as a poison for bullets</p>

   <h1>4. Cerbera odollam (Most commonly known as Pong Pong tree)</h1>
   <p>The seeds contain cerberin, a potent toxin related to digoxin. The poison blocks the calcium ion channels in heart muscle, causing disruption of the heartbeat. This is typically fatal and can result from ingesting a single seed. Cerberin is difficult to detect in autopsies and its taste can be masked with strong spices, such as a curry. It is often used in homicide and suicide in India</p>
