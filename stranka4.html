  <div class="plant-description">
      <p>A slender, upright plant with long, narrow, grey-green leaves covered in fine hairs. It produces bright, star-shaped flowers that are typically vivid pink to purple, each with five petals marked by dark lines running from the center outward. The plant can grow quite tall, often blending among cereal crops.</p>

<br>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The corn-cockle is native to Europe but has spread to many parts of the world, including North America, Australia, and New Zealand. It typically grows in fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, especially among cereal crops like wheat.</p>
<br>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Agrostemma githago is a tall, slender annual plant that can reach up to 100 cm in height. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, purple-pink flowers with five petals. Its seeds are contained in small capsules and are highly toxic if ingested.</p>
<br>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, corn-cockle was a common weed in European grain fields. While it added beauty to agricultural landscapes, it posed a significant danger due to its toxicity. Harvesting wheat often meant collecting some corn-cockle seeds unintentionally, leading to poisoned flour and food.</p>
<p>Efforts to improve seed cleaning and agricultural practices in the 20th century have dramatically reduced its presence in modern fields, though it can still be found in wildflower gardens and conservation areas.</p>
<br>

<h2>Toxicology</h2>
<p>The plant contains toxic compounds called saponins, particularly githagin and agrostemmic acid. Consuming even small amounts of the seeds can cause nausea, vomiting, respiratory failure, and, in severe cases, death. All parts of the plant are considered poisonous, but the seeds are especially dangerous.</p>
<br>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms of corn-cockle poisoning include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, breathing difficulties, and heart irregularities. In severe cases, poisoning can lead to coma or death if untreated. Prompt medical attention is critical if ingestion is suspected.</p>
