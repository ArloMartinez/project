    <h1>info</h1>
<p>Agrostemma is a genus of annual plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, containing the species known as corncockles. Its best-known member is A. githago, the common corncockle, which is a native of Europe.[1] The species is a weed of cereals and other crops, probably with a centre of origin in the eastern Mediterranean.[2] It occurs as a weed worldwide, but is declining in its native range because of improved seed cleaning.[citation needed] Corncockle is an attractive plant, and its seeds are still commercially available to gardeners.</p>
